- Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet `1.91 : 1`, the image will be scaled and cropped.  
- setting the imageâ€™s attribute:
```yaml
image:
  path: /path/to/image
  alt: image alternative text
```
For simple use, you can also just use `image: /path/to/image` to define the path.
